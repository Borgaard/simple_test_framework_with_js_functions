# Homework: Build a trivial test framework 

When you write code for your future job, you'll more than likely start
by writing the tests for your code. 

Tonight, you'll write a very trivial test framework that may be used 
to run the test suite that is in this repo, under the filename 
`test_suite.js`.

In `test_suite.js`, you'll see that the things being tested are:
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers - some of
the basic operations you may perform in JavaScript, by using the
built-in operators.

The same simplistic test framework that you will write tonight, may be
used to run other test suites, that follow the same patterns.

The framework takes inspiration from mocha and jasmine for the structure
of the functions that you need to define for the framework to do its
job.

The test suite shall be runnable via node, by typing in `node
test_suite.js` at your terminal.
